        <h2> Killing Ocean Animals:</h2>
    <p> Around the world animals are dying due to the amount of littering that is produced. The ocean is filled with deadly amounts of trash, leading to high rates of death in sea turtles, fish, birds, and more animals. Plastic bags and nets are a very big issues, they are mistaken for food and can kill any animal that consumes it. Around the worls the ocean is estimated to be filled with about 13,000 pieces of trash in every kilometer. The biggest issues is we have no clue what the effect is going to be in the long run.</p>
        <!-- second paragraph--> 
        <h2> What to do:</h2>
    <p> The solution to this issues is not as big as you think it would be. Simply pick up trash whenever you see it, especially around and in the ocean. It can make a veruy big difference in the world if everyone participated. <b>Reduce, Reuse, Recycle</b> if everyone did this simple task we wouldn't have to worry about all the plastic killing animals. Stop using plastic bags in the grocery store!!! Bring your own grocery store bag that is reusable each time. Lastly be aware of where you put your trash, dont release plastic balloons into the air, and always choose recycling when throwing something plastic away!</p>

Fishing nets taking about 600 and glass bottles take a million years. This should show many how bad the issue of littering is around the world. The earth is filled with 70% of water, making there be a lot of fish and animals in the room. One million seabirds are killed every year. About 100,00 different animals are killed such as marine mammals and turtles. 260 animals are found in nets and tangled up. This is a very serious issues that is very easy to fix.  </p>
